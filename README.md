# Testing the Instagram API
####*Updated: Jan 8, 2014*

For my new project, I created an automatic Instagram photo liker!. It does what you think it does; it likes photos on instagram so you don’t have to do it yourself. The script is tremendously useful if you have an objective to expand the market reach of your account.

I got a bit distracted while creating the script because I wanted it to have features which would automate getting the user’s IP Address instead of manually searching it from Google every time I run it. Basically Instagram has gotten so much stricter now that it needs developer’s to authenticate themselves and send encrypted code using the user’s current IP Address and Instagram Key. However, since my IP Address is dynamically generated and can change without prior notice, you always have to check on Google what your IP is or else the script would only have limited privileges when you run it.

I also learned about wrappers which I use to know whether the a method has timed out or not.
